# Project description: 

A simple platformer made with [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com) (<3) to test out the [Odin language](https://odin-lang.org/) (it's cool).

## Useful code: 

1. The section of the project that parses 'Tiled' tilemaps might be useful to others, it's in the ```tiled``` folder. The code is dead simple though, just about worth copy pasting the ```parse_tileset``` function.
1. ```update_phys_obj``` procedure showcases Odin's excellent swizzling, maths, fixed array programming stuff, and it's brilliant.
1. ```main``` procedure illustrates how to very simply use Raylib in Odin.
